## Indexing in Python

Ever needed to extract elements of a String? Like the first character or the first one?
You can use indexing in Python to extract the needed elements.

You use square brackets and within the square brackets is specified which index have to been extracted.
So let's understand indexing in Python:

"Variable" [index_of_element] means as example:

In Python we count from zero not from one:

"PYTHON"

print("PYTHON"[0])
> P

print("PYTHON"[1])
> Y


*This is how indexing with Python works. You refer to the object and Parse through the indexies from zero to the last character.*
