## IF statement in Python

The power of programming is to define the reaction of your program depending on events or User Input.

*IF statement* allows your Python program to make decisions you program previously. That's why it's very import for you to understand the Syntax.

> If Computer is turned on code Python. If Computer is turned off read Python Books.

This seems to be a very productive way to become better and better in Python, isn't?
We won't program this now do not worry. We will look at a easier example:

if 2 == 8 / 4:
    print ("Right")

> Right

As shown you can check with the IF statement one condition in Python. You are also able to define what should happen when the result of the IF statement is False:


What if the condition is not right? That's what you can see in the next example:


if 2 == 8 / 4:
    print ("Right")
else:
    print ("Not right")

> Right


if 2 == 8 / 4:
    print ("Right")
else:
    print ("Not right")

> Not right

As you can see the most powerful here is that you can determine what should happen in case a condition is not False.
Think about a big structured program which should react depending on the Input
*The program dicides between two options: A True condition or a False condition.*
